# Cryptocurrencies-Challenge
## Purpose of the analysis
Created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the Advisory Services Team new investment.
## Short description
1- Processed data to fit the machine learning models.   
2- Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we decided to use unsupervised learning.   
3- To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm.   
4- We used data visualizations to share our findings with the board.
